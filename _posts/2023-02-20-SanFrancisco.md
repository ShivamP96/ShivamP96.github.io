## Trip Details

So I recently went on a trip to San Francisco around late January. This was a spontaneous trip where my buddy was able to go for a work conference and everything else was paid for, so I thought why not just tag along.

<br>
I had the first 2 days to just do my own work and chill. I was pretty close to the Computer History Museum so I went inside.

<br>

I have to say, this Museum was the most
insprational moment in my tech career so far. I always loved tech as a kid and I got to see the old floppy discs that I got to play with and see what those originated from.

I've attached a bynch of photos from my time at the Museum and I hope that anyone who gets a chance can go and really experience how the technology they are using today came to be!

## Pictures

Some highlights, I'll figure out how to put a nice grid later on.

|                       _IBM Tube Computer_                        |

This machine is so big, that it takes up a bedroom and with multiple comptuers it will take up a whole computer lab.

|                          _Optical Storage_                          |

Who here rememebers the CD, I used to use these all the time. Infact who even remembers the Floppy Disc. I feel pretty lucky to have been able to use one. I think if I had the Space I would be hoarding all of this, alas we don't have infinte storage space........correction physical storage space ..... see what I did there?

| :-------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                     _Japanese Chip Dumping_                     |

If you have the time, then you should loko into the chip dumping and into "Fujio Masuoka", who invented Flash Memory. Basically why we now don't have to carry around a whole hard drive everywhere

| ![Software](/assets/img/ComputerHistoryMuseum/IMG_2105.jpeg) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|                        _Software&IBM_                        |

Look at the article in the back right, looks familiar to what we have been seeing in the news a lot right? Keep your data safe kids.

| :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|                      _War and Rockets_                      |

Ever Wondered how rockets knew how to find their trajectory and well... hit the target. Computers that's how and lots of math

| ![Super Computer](/assets/img/ComputerHistoryMuseum/IMG_2116.jpeg) |

|                          _Super Computer_                          |

The first super computer looked like this.... Pretty cool right?
Its called the CRAY-1, unveiled by seymour Cray in 1976

## Now its time for some nostalgia

|                          _Robots_                          |

Compare these robots of the AI that you have today.

|                   _Pet Dog AIBO, Sony_                   |

Ever wanted a pet dog, well you could have one in 1999 for $2000

| ![Robot Term](/assets/img/ComputerHistoryMuseum/IMG_2120.jpeg) |

|                          _Robot Term_                          |

Tilt your Head to read where the term "robot"
originated from

|                          _IBM Computer_                          |

Take at look at one of IBM's first family computers

|                      _Pixar Machine_                      |

Ever wondered how your favorite, Pixar movies were made, they used this machine to do all of the computation.

|                         _Playstation 1_                         |

I loved Playing on the PS1 as a kid, we hacked the system and were able to play a bunch of normal games on CD's.

At the time of writing this, I have the latest PS5. Its been a long time eh...

Read this cool fact, I bet you didn't know that.

|                          _MRI_                          |

I have a background in Medical Physics, so seeing what we learned in school and how to turn magnetic waves into images has been a great inspiration to me.

|                          _MP3_                          |

Ever wondered how MP3's work, take a look.

I highly recommend anyone who's interested in tech to visit the museum.

Also a little hint, as of 2023 they close at 5PM so if you go at 3 PM the entrace fee is discounted to $11.
