    "content": "Trip DetailsSo I recently went on a trip to San Francisco around late January. This was a spontaneous trip where my buddy was able to go for a work conference and everything else was paid for, so I thought why not just tag along.I had the first 2 days to just do my own work and chill. I was pretty close to the Computer History Museum so I went inside.I have to say, this Museum was the mostinsprational moment in my tech career so far. I always loved tech as a kid and I got to see the old floppy discs that I got to play with and see what those originated from.I’ve attached a bynch of photos from my time at the Museum and I hope that anyone who gets a chance can go and really experience how the technology they are using today came to be!PicturesSome highlights, I’ll figure out how to put a nice grid later on.                              Entrance                                    IBM Key Punch                                    IBM Tube Computer      This machine is so big, that it takes up a bedroom and with multiple comptuers it will take up a whole computer lab.                              Optical Storage      Who here rememebers the CD, I used to use these all the time. Infact who even remembers the Floppy Disc. I feel pretty lucky to have been able to use one. I think if I had the Space I would be hoarding all of this, alas we don’t have infinte storage space……..correction physical storage space ….. see what I did there?                              Japanese Chip Dumping      If you have the time, then you should loko into the chip dumping and into “Fujio Masuoka”, who invented Flash Memory. Basically why we now don’t have to carry around a whole hard drive everywhere                              Software&amp;IBM      Look at the article in the back right, looks familiar to what we have been seeing in the news a lot right? Keep your data safe kids.                              War and Rockets      Ever Wondered how rockets knew how to find their trajectory and well… hit the target. Computers that’s how and lots of math                              Super Computer      The first super computer looked like this…. Pretty cool right?Its called the CRAY-1, unveiled by seymour Cray in 1976Now its time for some nostalgia                              Robots      Compare these robots of the AI that you have today.                              Pet Dog AIBO, Sony      Ever wanted a pet dog, well you could have one in 1999 for $2000                              Robot Term      Tilt your Head to read where the term “robot”originated from                              Pixar Machine      Ever wondered how your favorite, Pixar movies were made, they used this machine to do all of the computation.                              Web      Some web history                              MRI      I have a background in Medical Physics, so seeing what we learned in school and how to turn magnetic waves into images has been a great inspiration to me.                              MP3      Ever wondered how MP3’s work, take a look.I highly recommend anyone who’s interested in tech to visit the museum.Also a little hint, as of 2023 they close at 5PM so if you go at 3 PM the entrace fee is discounted to $11."
